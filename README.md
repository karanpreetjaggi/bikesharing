# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze if it is worth investing in bike renting business. In this project we used Tableau as our main tool. One of the important KPI we looked at is, TripDuration - How long were the trips are for in the month of August. How long the bikes are being rented for? What is the most popular time to rent a bike? The data visualization helped us making inform decision.  

# Methodology
We used Tableau as a tool for visualization. We uploaded the csv file and used the data to help visualize the data. We also change the column that records the trip duration from seconds to hours, minutes and seconds.

# Results
- Total number of trips were 2,344,224.
- Total trips for users type subsbriber were 1,900,359 and 443,865 users type custom.
- Male populations are more in the subscribers category.
- Time from 5pm-6pm is the best time when riders ride the bike most especially males.

# Summary
After doing data analysis, it seems that Thursday is the most preferred day to ride a bike. It would be great to use this data and convinvce people in other cities to start the bikehsare program whether for work or leisur especially in summers. The only suggestion would be to do a data analysis on the colder months to see if we have a dip in the number of riders.
